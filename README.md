# NumPy-Based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Handwritten Digit Classification
This project implements an artificial neural network (ANN) using only the NumPy library and calculus. The goal is to classify greyscale 28x28 images of different handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The data was first preprocessed using Pandas to prepare it for training.

The implemented ANN achieved an impressive accuracy score of 91% on unseen data. The entire implementation is based on NumPy and calculus, allowing me to gain a deep understanding of the fundamental functionalities of neural networks before moving on to more advanced libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Packages Used
Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib
